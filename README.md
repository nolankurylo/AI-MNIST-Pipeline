# AI-MNIST-Pipeline
This project is a demonstration of an end-to-end machine learning application to outline my understanding and experience building ground-up AI applications and deploying them into an AWS production environment. The focus of this project is not so much on the machine learning within the application itself but more on the step-by-step process that needs to occur to successfully deliver an AI model into production with a purpose; such as for a business client or company.  

The way I like to think about it is this: it doesn't really matter how good the AI/ML application is if you don't understand the organization and steps needed to achieve meaningful results, not to mention actually being able to use the application online. From my experience, the process doesn't deviate much; I want to showcase that no matter the application I am given, I have a solid understanding of the fundemental structure needed to orchestrate an entire machine learning pipeline from data collection all the way to deployment.
